Submission File: lab0-004921527.tar.gz

Tarball Contents:

lab0.c: C source code file that copies from standard input to standard output.
--input=[FILE] option specifies a file to use as stdin.
--output=[FILE] option specifies a file to use as stdout.
--segfault option forces a segmentation fault.
--catch option creates a signal handler for SIGSEGV to catch a possible segmentation fault.

Makefile: contains the 4 targets described below.
default - builds lab0 executable, with options -g -Wall -Wextra.
check - runs a smoke test on the lab0 executable (more below).
clean - deletes any/all files created by the Makefile (includes tarball, executable, text files).
dist - builds the distribution tarball for assignment submission.

check.sh: shell script called by the Makefile (make check) to run the smoke test on lab0 executable. Below are the checks run.
1. Check for successful run (exit code 0) of copying from input file to output file.
2. Check for exit code 1 upon reading an unsupported command line option.
3. Check for exit code 2 upon inability to open the specified input file.
4. Check for exit code 3 upon inability to open/write to the specified output file.
5. Check for exit code 4 upon successfully catching a segmentation fault.
6. Check for exit code 139 (default for a segfault) upon successfully forcing a segmentation fault (no catch option).
